# MandelbrotSet
Algorithmic Art generation using Mandelbrot Set created as a project for the **Procedural Content Generation** (PCG) course.

* Mandelbrot Set is a collection of complex numbers with real and imaginary part.
* Mandelbrot set images use sampling complex numbers, for which it is defined whether the walk’s result tends to infinity when a particular mathematical operation is iterated on it.
* It is important to mention that any point of the walk should belong to the range from -2 to 2, in order to not to escape from the set. Then such point is called an “escape point” and it is used for determining color of the particle.
